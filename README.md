## Why emojis?!
Beside this language, there are existing many other great golfing languages.
We want to be a part of that community and try to push code-golfing to the next level by providing a new beautiful, short and funny golfing-language for everyone!

## What do we have so far?
We have just started, trying to implement an golfmoji-interpreter.

We are still planning, how we want to structure the language itself and how it works behind the scenes.
We also try to implement some common golf-problems.

## What is planned for the future?
First we want to implement a working golfmoji-interpreter, which will be written entirely in Crystal.

## Why we (will) talk about "bytes" at code-golf?

We will only allow **256** *(= 2^8)* emojis.
Therefore we can simply create a emoji-code-table:

## Commit-Conventions
Of course, each commit-message *should* contain at least one emoji. 

Here are the most important guide-lines, which emoji you could use for each commit-type:

| emoji | commit-type |
|-------|-------------|
| ‚ú® | features |
| üêõ | fixes     |
| üî® | refactoring |
